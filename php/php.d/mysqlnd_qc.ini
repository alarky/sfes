; Enables or disables the plugin. If disabled the extension will not
; plug into mysqlnd to proxy internal mysqlnd C API calls.

; Default Time-to-Live (TTL) for cache entries in seconds.

; Cache all queries regardless if they begin with the SQL hint that enables
; caching of a query or not. Storage handler cannot overrule the setting.
; It is evaluated by the core of the plugin.

; Use PHP global request time to avoid gettimeofday() system calls? If using APC
; storage handler it should be set to the value of apc.use_request_time,
; if not warnings will be generated.

; Data will be collected only if you also set mysqlnd_qc.collect_statistics = 1,

; Collect statistics for mysqlnd_qc_get_core_stats()? Does not influence storage handler
; statistics! Handler statistics can be an integral part of the handler internal 
; storage format. Thereofore, collection of some handler statistics cannot be disabled.

; If mysqlnd_qc.collect_statistics and mysqlnd_qc.collect_statistics_log_file are set,

; Whether to remove SQL comments from a query string before hashing it to generate a cache key.
; Disable if you do not want two statemts such as SELECT /*my_source_ip=123*/ id FROM test;
